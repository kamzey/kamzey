### Zeynep's Profile
*(pronounced Zai-nap)*\
\
Originally a biomedical engineer but I do love all things coding even if they're not biomedical...\
*EXCELLENT* in **Python**!!! Especially data science and data manipulation libraries.\
\
Jokes aside I do have quite a bit of experience with...\
... pandas, numpy, Dask \
... PyTorch, statsmodels, scipy\
... Apache Airflow\
... Docker\
... MATLAB for signal processing\
\
Unfortunately Git was a skill learned later on in life and work code isn't open source so not many quality repos (yet!).\
\
Currently working on STEMCupid which is a web application that scrapes job boards to find you jobs in two differrent professions within a certain distance of each other. Name is pretty self-explanatory imo.\
\
Hope to see you again!!!\
